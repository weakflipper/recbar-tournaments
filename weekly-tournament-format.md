# Overview
## Registration
 Once the entry fee is collected, the person will be registered as a player. Once all players are registered, shortly after the start time (6pm), the qualifying rounds will begin.

## Qualifying Rounds
The qualifying rounds are in Group Matchplay format. Players are grouped (player pairing) into four and are asssigned a machine to play. If there is a number of players not divisble by four, then a three player game will be held.

### Player pairing
Players are grouped together in a "Balanced" setting, where "Players will be randomly paired with previously unfaced opponents" in the given round.

### Round scoring
Once the game has been completed, each player will have points added beside their name as followed:\
1st place = 7 points\
2nd place = 5 points\
3rd place = 3 points\
4th place = 1 point

Three player games will have:\
1st place = 7 points\
2nd place = 4 points\
3rd place = 1 point

Once all games have been completed in the current round, the round will be closed. If the time is still prior to 8pm, then a new round will begin.

### End of Qualifying Rounds
Typically the last round will be right after 8pm, however under the discretion of the tournament director, one more round may be completed. This is to allow for the most IFPA points to be awarded to the weekly tournament as possible.

Upon the last qualifying round, a determination of whether a playoff needs to occur for any ties for last place into the finals. 

### Ties for finals qualifying
If there is a tie amongst players for qualifying into the final round, a one game playoff will be started amongst the ties. The game chosen will be random among all games. 

If there are more than four players in the tie, then a playoff will occur with the number of players being balanced amongst the minimal amount of machines. Examples:\
7 players = Game A: 4 players, Game B: 3 players\
12 players = Game A: 4 players, Game B: 4 players, Game C: 4 players\
Top winner will proceed to the finals. If there were multiple matches, the winners of the matches will play on one random game.

## Final Rounds
The Final round is in a 3-game | Group-Elimination / PAPA Finals format.\

The number of players in the finals will be determined based on the number of players in the overall (qualifying) tournament:


|# in Tourney | no in Finals|
| ------------ | ----------- |
|<25 | 8
|25-32 | 12 (Top 4 receive a bye)|
|33-48 | 16|
|49-56|24 (Top 8 receive a bye)|
|57-64|28 (Top 4 receive a bye)|
|65-128|32|
|129-256|64|


Finalists will be paired into four player groups.
Each round will consist of 3 games.

Same point system (7/5/3/1) for 4-player or (7/4/1) for 3-player will be used.\
Top two players in each group advances to the next round.

## Payouts
100% of all money collected is paid out to the top players. Payouts are approximate, as no coin is wanted too be used for paying out.\
There are times when tournaments will be sponsored, which money is donated to the pool. The money will first pay for the admission to all players that made it to the finals. The remaining will then be disbursed amongst the payout percentages.

The following is the payout percentages based on the number of players submitted:

| Place | <23 | 24-31 | 32-47 | 48 - 64 |
| :----- | --- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1st | 40% | 30% | 30% | 25% |
| 2nd | 30% | 25% | 25% | 20% |
| 3rd | 20% | 20% | 15% | 15% |
| 4th | 10% | 15% | 10% | 10% |
| 5th-6th | | 5% | 5% | 5% |
| 7th-8th | | | 5% | 5% |
| 9th-12th | | | | 2.5% |

**If there is money donated to the prize pool, all finalists will have their tournament entry ($5 refunded)**

## IFPA submission
The IFPA fee is paid by Recbar. As far as IFPA points go, the worth of the tournament is based on the player ranks, but we try hard to get a high Tournament Grading Percentage (TGP).

The format for the weekly allows for a close to 100% TGP.
Per the WPPR 5.3, TGP can be calculated:


Finals: Using the PAPA Matchplay Finals format, the dumbed down TGP for finals is:

| #of finalists | Meaningful Games | TGP % |
| :--- | --- | -- |
| 8 | 12 | 48% |
| 12 | 18 | 72% |
| 16 | 18 | 72% |
| 24 | 24 | 96% |
| 28 | 24 | 96% |
| 32 | 24 | 96% |
| 64 | 30 | 100% |

**Since the finals limits the field by 50% or more, the qualifying round can be added:**\
Qualifying TGP% = (number of rounds played (aka games played) X 2) X .04

**Thus, the total TGP will be close to 100% if there were 6 rounds of games in Qualifying with a finals of at least 12 people.**


# Official / Legal crap
This write-up is to the best my knowledge and there could well be some typos. The #1 goal is to have fun! It is possible that the rules have changed from what is posted here by the tournament director, which the tournament director takes the precedence.\
If you have an issue with the tournament (game goes down, don't like the draw, etc..), there is only so much that can be done.
