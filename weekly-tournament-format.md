# Overview
## Registration
 Once the entry fee is collected, the person will be registered as a player. Qualifying rounds will be begin shortly after the start time (6pm).

New players can join the tournament as long as it is before the last qualifying round, and the new player pays in exact change $5.00. The new player will then be added to the next round in the qualifying tournament by the Tournament Director.

## Qualifying Rounds
The qualifying rounds are in Group Matchplay format. Players are grouped (player pairing) into four and are assigned a machine to play. If there is a number of players not divisible by four, then a three player game will be held.

### Player pairing
Players are grouped together in a "Balanced" setting, where "Players will be randomly paired with previously unfaced opponents" in the given round.

### Round scoring
Once the game has been completed, each player will have points added beside their name as followed:\
1st place = 7 points\
2nd place = 5 points\
3rd place = 3 points\
4th place = 1 point

Three player games will have:\
1st place = 7 points\
2nd place = 4 points\
3rd place = 1 point

Once all games have been completed in the current round, the round will be closed. If the time is still prior to 8pm, then a new round will begin.

### End of Qualifying Rounds
Typically the last round will be right after 8pm, however under the discretion of the tournament director, one more round may be completed. This is to allow for the most IFPA points to be awarded to the weekly tournament as possible and/or if the tournament began late for some reason.

Upon the last qualifying round, tiebreaking rules will be used to determine finals position and seed order.

### Ties for finals qualifying
Ties will be automatically broken based on the number of First and Second place finishes by the players that are tied. If there is still a tie amongst players for some reason, then additional steps will be taken to determine final position.

#### Ties for finals qualifying - finals entries and byes
For determining finals entry or byes, a one game playoff will be started amongst tie groups as followed:

The game chosen will be random among all games.

If there are more than four players in the tie, then a playoff will occur with the number of players being balanced amongst the minimal amount of machines. Examples:\
7 players = Game A: 4 players, Game B: 3 players\
12 players = Game A: 4 players, Game B: 4 players, Game C: 4 players\
Top winner will proceed to the finals or get a bye. If there were multiple matches, the winners of the matches will play on one random game.

#### Ties for finals qualifying - seeding only
In the event that two or more players are tied only with regards to finals seeding (not for finals entry or byes), then each players' current IFPA ranking will be used.  Highest IFPA ranking results in highest seed.   If a player involved in the seed tiebreak is not yet ranked, they are the lowest seed.   If multiple players are unranked, a "one ball" tiebreak game will be played among the unranked players, scores determine seed within that group.

## Final Rounds
The Final round is in a 3-game | Group-Elimination / PAPA Finals format.

The number of players in the finals will be determined based on the number of players in the overall (qualifying) tournament:


|# in Tourney | no in Finals|
| ------------ | ----------- |
|<25 | 8
|25-32 | 12 (Top 4 receive a bye)|
|33-48 | 16|
|49-56|24 (Top 8 receive a bye)|
|57-64|28 (Top 4 receive a bye)|
|65-128|32|
|129-256|64|

Finalists will be paired into four player groups.
Each round will consist of 3 games.
Seeding in finals is determined during qualifying and carries forward throughout all finals rounds.

Choice of position for game 1 will go to the highest seeded player within that group based on the standings entering that session, second choice will go to the 2nd highest seeded player, third choice will go to the 3rd highest seeded player and the lowest seeded player will have the remaining choice. 

In subsequent games, the player finishing in 4th place will have choice of position for Game 2. The player finishing in 3rd place will have 2nd choice of position. The player finishing in 2nd place will have 3rd choice of position. The player finishing in 1st place will have the remaining position.


Same point system (7/5/3/1) for 4-player or (7/4/1) for 3-player will be used.\
Top two players in each group advances to the next round.

## Payouts
100% of all money collected is paid out to the top players. Payouts are approximate, as no coin is wanted too be used for paying out.\
There are times when tournaments will be sponsored, which money is donated to the pool. The money will first pay for the admission to all players that made it to the finals. The remaining will then be disbursed amongst the payout percentages.

The following is the payout percentages based on the number of players submitted:

| Place | <23 | 24-31 | 32-47 | 48 - 64 |
| :----- | --- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1st | 40% | 30% | 30% | 25% |
| 2nd | 30% | 25% | 25% | 20% |
| 3rd | 20% | 20% | 15% | 15% |
| 4th | 10% | 15% | 10% | 10% |
| 5th-6th | | 5% | 5% | 5% |
| 7th-8th | | | 5% | 5% |
| 9th-12th | | | | 2.5% |

**If there is money donated to the prize pool, all finalists will have their tournament entry ($5 refunded)**

## IFPA submission
The IFPA fee is paid by Recbar. As far as IFPA points go, the worth of the tournament is based on the player ranks, but we try hard to get a high Tournament Grading Percentage (TGP).

The format for the weekly allows for a close to 100% TGP.
Per the WPPR 5.3, TGP can be calculated:


Finals: Using the PAPA Matchplay Finals format, the dumbed down TGP for finals is:

| #of finalists | Meaningful Games | TGP % |
| :--- | --- | -- |
| 8 | 12 | 48% |
| 12 | 18 | 72% |
| 16 | 18 | 72% |
| 24 | 24 | 96% |
| 28 | 24 | 96% |
| 32 | 24 | 96% |
| 64 | 30 | 100% |

**Since the finals limits the field by 50% or more, the qualifying round can be added:**\
Qualifying TGP% = (number of rounds played (aka games played) X 2) X .04

**Thus, the total TGP will be close to 100% if there were 6 rounds of games in Qualifying with a finals of at least 12 people.**

# Games Used
Games used will be determined to the best of the knowledge of each game based upon if it is considered "fair" for tournament play, as well as the condition of the game.   Where appropriate and available, "tournament" or "competition" settings are enabled.

A game with a known major malfunction will not be in the tournament. If for some reason a game is in the tournament, but fails on the next round, the game will be taken out from the tournament and will not be reused.

This is under the discretion of the Tournament Director.

# Official / Legal crap
This write-up is to the best my knowledge and there could well be some typos. The #1 goal is to have fun! It is possible that the rules have changed from what is posted here by the tournament director, which the tournament director takes the precedence.\
If you have an issue with the tournament (game goes down, don't like the draw, etc..), there is only so much that can be done.

New players added must be notified to the Tournament Director before the round they play in has begun. This is to ensure that the fees have been collected so that payouts can be accurately determined.

Games that are taken out from a round will not be put back in to another round, unless the game has been thoroughly tested. Games can only be put back into the tournament by the tournament director.
